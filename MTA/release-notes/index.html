			Migration Toolkit for Applications (MTA) version 8.0.0 provides the following major new features and enhancements.
		</p><div class="formalpara"><p class="title"><strong>Developer Lightspeed for MTA is available in the VS Code extension</strong></p><p>
				You can opt to use Developer Lightspeed for MTA features in the VS Code extension. With the Developer Lightspeed feature, you can use a large language model (LLM) of your choice to request code changes for resolving the issues found through a static code analysis of your Java application.
			</p></div><p>
			The Developer Lightspeed for MTA core features are the following:
		</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p class="simpara">
					RAG solution: The Developer Lightspeed for MTA uses Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) for context-based resolutions of issues in code. Developer Lightspeed improves the context shared with the LLM to generate more accurate suggestions to fix the issue in the code.
				</p><p class="simpara">
					The context is a combination of the source code, the issue description, and solved examples. Solved examples contain code changes you accepted for other migrations, code you manually modified, and a pattern of resolution for an issue that you can use in the future.
				</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="simpara">
					Solution Server (Technology Preview): Solution Server is a component that allows Developer Lightspeed for MTA to build a collective memory of code changes from all analysis performed in an organization. It also works with the LLM to improve the pattern of resolutions from solved examples for future analysis.
				</p><p class="simpara">
					The Solution Server delivers two primary benefits to users:
				</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="circle"><li class="listitem">
							Contextual Hints: It surfaces examples of past migration solutions, including successful user modifications and accepted fixes, offering actionable hints for difficult or previously unsolved migration problems.
						</li><li class="listitem">
							Migration Success Metrics: It exposes detailed success metrics for each migration rule, derived from real-world usage data. These metrics can be used by IDEs or automation tools to present users with a “confidence level” or likelihood of Developer Lightspeed for MTA successfully resolving a given migration issue or incident.
						</li></ul></div></li><li class="listitem">
					Agentic AI (Technology Preview): In the agent mode, Developer Lightspeed for MTA makes iterative resolutions to issues in code. If you accept the suggested resolutions, Developer Lightspeed scans the code for diagnostic or linting issues that can be created due to the accepted solution and fixes those issues. NOTE: To obtain support for features in Developer Lightspeed for MTA, you need an active Red Hat Advanced Developer Suite (RHADS) subscription. (<a class="link" href="https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTA-5378">MTA-5738</a>)
				</li></ul></div><div class="formalpara"><p class="title"><strong>MTA supports platform awareness to import applications from source platform instances</strong></p><p>
				You can use platform awareness to discover applications from a source platform and import them into the MTA application inventory. MTA discovers the applications by their coordinates in the source platform where they are deployed. With platform awareness, you can use the platform and runtime configurations of applications to create a discovery manifest that can be used to generate other deployment assets. In MTA 8.0.0, you can discover applications deployed in the Cloud Foundry platform.
			</p></div><p>
			(<a class="link" href="https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTA-4846">MTA-4846</a>)
		</p><div class="formalpara"><p class="title"><strong>MTA supports asset generation for application migration in the web console</strong></p><p>
				You can use the discovery manifest to generate assets in the web console to deploy applications in Red Hat OpenShift or Kubernetes. The asset generation workflow includes generators, target profiles, and the archetypes. Generators parse the application manifest configurations to create the deployment assets for a specific kind of target platform. In the target profiles, you can run one or more generators in sequence for a given archetype.
			</p></div><p>
			(<a class="link" href="https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTA-4847">MTA-4847</a>)
		</p><div class="formalpara"><p class="title"><strong>MTA CLI supports running a live discovery in a remote CF instance</strong></p><p>
				With this update, you can perform a live discovery if you want to determine what is deployed in a certain Cloud Foundry (CF) cluster. For example, you can determine how many applications are in the cluster. You can also use the live discovery if you do not have access to manifest YAML files.
			</p></div><p>
			For more information, see <a class="link" href="https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/migration_toolkit_for_applications/8.0/html/cli_guide/generating-assets_cli-guide#performing-a-live-discovery_generating-assets">Performing a live discovery in a remote CF instance</a>.

			(<a class="link" href="https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTA-4847">MTA-4847</a>)
		</p><div class="formalpara"><p class="title"><strong>MTA CLI supports concealing sensitive information in a discovery manifest</strong></p><p>
				You can conceal sensitive information, for example, services and Docker credentials, in a Cloud Foundry (CF) discovery manifest by using the <code class="literal">mta-cli discover cloud-foundry --conceal-sensitive-data</code> command. This command generates the following files:
			</p></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem">
					A discovery manifest
				</li><li class="listitem">
					A file with concealed data
				</li></ul></div><p>

		</p><div class="formalpara"><p class="title"><strong>Analysis insights are available in the MTA UI</strong></p><p>
				Analysis insights contain information about the technologies used in the application and their usage in the code. Before this update, insights were only available in the analysis output and a static report after you ran an application analysis. With this enhancement, you can access analysis insights also from the Migration Toolkit for Applications (MTA) user interface (UI).
			</p></div><p>
			(<a class="link" href="https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTA-5420">MTA-5420</a>)
		</p><div class="formalpara"><p class="title"><strong>A new VS Code IDE plug-in for application analysis</strong></p><p>
				With this enhancement, you can use a new Visual Studio Code (VS Code) IDE plug-in that has the following features:
			</p></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem">
					Standard application analysis and issue detection
				</li><li class="listitem"><p class="simpara">
					Generative AI (GenAI) feature:
				</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="circle"><li class="listitem">
							When enabled, you can use GenAI to find solutions for the analysis incidents. Note that GenAI is enabled by default.
						</li><li class="listitem">
							When disabled, you can run a standard application analysis.
						</li></ul></div><p class="simpara">
					NOTE: You must restart your server after changing the Gen AI settings for the change to take effect.
				</p></li></ul></div><p>

		</p><div class="formalpara"><p class="title"><strong>Setting default credentials is supported in the MTA UI</strong></p><p>
				Before this update, you could only assign credentials to an application manually once you added or imported this application to the Migration Toolkit for Applications (MTA) user interface (UI). However, you might need to import a large set of applications, each of these applications requiring credentials for language and technology discovery tasks. With this update, instead of manually defining credentials, you can define credentials that will be used by default for an application that does not have any credentials assigned to it.
			</p></div><div class="admonition important"><div class="admonition_header">Important</div><div><p>
				You can only set Maven or source control credentials as default credentials. You can only define one default set of credentials per credential type.
			</p></div></div><p>

		</p><div class="formalpara"><p class="title"><strong>The Eclipse IDE plugin is removed</strong></p><p>
				The Eclipse IDE plugin for Migration Toolkit for Applications (MTA), which you could use to analyze the effort for migrating and modernizing your applications, is removed and is no longer supported. As an alternative, you can use the Migration Toolkit for Applications extension for Visual Studio Code (VS Code).
			</p></div></section><section class="chapter" id="known-issues-8-0_release-notes"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title">Chapter 4. Known issues</h1></div></div></div><p>
			Migration Toolkit for Applications (MTA) version 8.0.0 is affected by the following newly identified and previously known issues. A known issue is listed in all future release notes until resolved, at which point it is published as a fixed issue.
		</p><div class="formalpara"><p class="title"><strong>Application analysis with MTA CLI might fail with the "invalid header line" error</strong></p><p>
				An application analysis by using the Migration Toolkit for Applications (MTA) command-line interface (CLI) might fail with the following error message:
			</p></div><pre class="screen">level=error msg="initialize failed" error="context canceled" provider=java
error="invalid header line "An error has occurred. See the log file"</pre><p>
			To work around this problem, clean up metadata and cache:

		</p><div class="formalpara"><p class="title"><strong><code class="literal">ANNOTATION</code> location rules do not match on FQNs</strong></p><p>
				The <code class="literal">ANNOTATION</code> search location does not properly use Fully Qualified Names (FQNs) to match annotations. This leads to incorrect matches and false positives in analysis issues. For example, a rule that searches for annotations using the <code class="literal">javax.enterprise.inject.Produces</code> pattern might incorrectly match the occurrences of the <code class="literal">javax.ws.rs.Produces</code> annotation in the source code.
			</p></div><p>
			No known workaround exists.

		</p><div class="formalpara"><p class="title"><strong>The default <code class="literal">values.yaml</code> file is merged with the discover <code class="literal">values.yaml</code> file when generating a deployment manifest</strong></p><p>
				Before this update, when you generated a deployment manifest by using the Helm template, the default values in the`values.yaml` file, packaged with the Helm chart, were ignored. Consequently, only the values from the <code class="literal">values.yaml</code> file created after running the <code class="literal">mta-cli discover</code> command were used. With this update, the default <code class="literal">values.yaml</code> file is merged with the discover <code class="literal">values.yaml</code> file.

		</p><div class="formalpara"><p class="title"><strong>MTA CLI no longer fails to detect dependencies for Gradle projects</strong></p><p>
				Before this update, when you ran an application analysis for Gradle projects in containerless mode, Migration Toolkit for Applications (MTA) command-line interface (CLI) did not detect Gradle dependencies. As a consequence, the analysis report did not list the dependencies and displayed an error message in the analysis logs instead. With this update, the issue is fixed. As a result, MTA CLI detects Gradle dependencies after the analysis is complete.

				Before this update, when you analyzed an application built with Gradle in <code class="literal">Source code + dependencies</code> mode in the Migration Toolkit for Applications (MTA) user interface (UI), the analysis failed if you had Gradle version 7 or later installed. With this update, the issue is fixed.

				Before this update, the <code class="literal">mta-cli discover</code> command only moved an application-level process with the process type explicitly defined to the <code class="literal">processes</code> block in the discovery manifest. Consequently, the discovery manifest did not list implicit application-level processes in the <code class="literal">processes</code> block. This resulted in the violation of the recommended clarity and proper configuration practices, especially if multiple process types were planned. With this update, <code class="literal">mta-cli discover</code> moves both implicit and explicit application-level process types to the <code class="literal">processes</code> block in the discovery manifest.

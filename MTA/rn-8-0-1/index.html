			</p><div class="formalpara"><p class="title"><strong>You can import Cloud Foundry applications from the application inventory in the MTA web console</strong></p><p>
					Before this update, an MTA Architect could not discover or import applications from the Cloud Foundry (CF) source platform on the application inventory page. As a result, only an MTA Administrator could import the applications from the Source Platform page in the Administrator mode. With this release, this issue is fixed. Architects can now import CF applications in the <span class="strong strong"><strong>Application Inventory</strong></span>. <a class="link" href="https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTA-6120">MTA-6120</a>
				</p></div><div class="formalpara"><p class="title"><strong>Cloud Foundry applications imported in MTA are tagged automatically</strong></p><p>
					When you imported applications in MTA from a Cloud Foundry (CF) instance, the applications did not contain the <code class="literal">Cloud Foundry</code> tag. The tag links an application to an archetype. The archetype has a generator that produces the deployment assets for a migration path. With this release, this issue is fixed. You no longer have to manually add the <code class="literal">Cloud Foundry</code> tag in the imported application. <a class="link" href="https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTA-6282">MTA-6282</a>

				Migration Toolkit for Applications (MTA) version 8.0.0 provides the following major new features and enhancements.
			</p><div class="formalpara"><p class="title"><strong>Red Hat Developer Lightspeed for MTA is available in the VS Code extension</strong></p><p>
					You can opt to use Red Hat Developer Lightspeed for MTA features in the VS Code extension. With the Developer Lightspeed feature, you can use a large language model (LLM) of your choice to request code changes for resolving the issues found through a static code analysis of your Java application.
				</p></div><p>
				The Red Hat Developer Lightspeed for MTA core features are the following:
			</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p class="simpara">
						RAG solution: The Red Hat Developer Lightspeed for MTA uses Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) for context-based resolutions of issues in code. Developer Lightspeed improves the context shared with the LLM to generate more accurate suggestions to fix the issue in the code.
					</p><p class="simpara">
						The context is a combination of the source code, the issue description, and solved examples. Solved examples contain code changes you accepted for other migrations, code you manually modified, and a pattern of resolution for an issue that you can use in the future.
					</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="simpara">
						Solution Server (Technology Preview): Solution Server is a component that allows Red Hat Developer Lightspeed for MTA to build a collective memory of code changes from all analysis performed in an organization. It also works with the LLM to improve the pattern of resolutions from solved examples for future analysis.
					</p><p class="simpara">
						The Solution Server delivers two primary benefits to users:
					</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="circle"><li class="listitem">
								Contextual Hints: It surfaces examples of past migration solutions, including successful user modifications and accepted fixes, offering actionable hints for difficult or previously unsolved migration problems.
							</li><li class="listitem">
								Migration Success Metrics: It exposes detailed success metrics for each migration rule, derived from real-world usage data. These metrics can be used by IDEs or automation tools to present users with a “confidence level” or likelihood of Red Hat Developer Lightspeed for MTA successfully resolving a given migration issue or incident.
							</li></ul></div></li><li class="listitem">
						Agentic AI (Technology Preview): In the agent mode, Red Hat Developer Lightspeed for MTA makes iterative resolutions to issues in code. If you accept the suggested resolutions, Developer Lightspeed scans the code for diagnostic or linting issues that can be created due to the accepted solution and fixes those issues. NOTE: To obtain support for features in Red Hat Developer Lightspeed for MTA, you need an active Red Hat Advanced Developer Suite (RHADS) subscription. (<a class="link" href="https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTA-5378">MTA-5738</a>)
					</li></ul></div><div class="formalpara"><p class="title"><strong>MTA supports platform awareness to import applications from source platform instances</strong></p><p>
					You can use platform awareness to discover applications from a source platform and import them into the MTA application inventory. MTA discovers the applications by their coordinates in the source platform where they are deployed. With platform awareness, you can use the platform and runtime configurations of applications to create a discovery manifest that can be used to generate other deployment assets. In MTA 8.0.0, you can discover applications deployed in the Cloud Foundry platform.
				</p></div><p>
				(<a class="link" href="https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTA-4846">MTA-4846</a>)
			</p><div class="formalpara"><p class="title"><strong>MTA supports asset generation for application migration in the web console</strong></p><p>
					You can use the discovery manifest to generate assets in the web console to deploy applications in Red Hat OpenShift or Kubernetes. The asset generation workflow includes generators, target profiles, and the archetypes. Generators parse the application manifest configurations to create the deployment assets for a specific kind of target platform. In the target profiles, you can run one or more generators in sequence for a given archetype.

			</p><div class="formalpara"><p class="title"><strong>MTA CLI supports running a live discovery in a remote CF instance</strong></p><p>
					With this update, you can perform a live discovery if you want to determine what is deployed in a certain Cloud Foundry (CF) cluster. For example, you can determine how many applications are in the cluster. You can also use the live discovery if you do not have access to manifest YAML files.
				</p></div><p>

			</p><div class="formalpara"><p class="title"><strong>MTA CLI supports concealing sensitive information in a discovery manifest</strong></p><p>
					You can conceal sensitive information, for example, services and Docker credentials, in a Cloud Foundry (CF) discovery manifest by using the <code class="literal">mta-cli discover cloud-foundry --conceal-sensitive-data</code> command. This command generates the following files:
				</p></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem">

			</p><div class="formalpara"><p class="title"><strong>Analysis insights are available in the MTA UI</strong></p><p>
					Analysis insights contain information about the technologies used in the application and their usage in the code. Before this update, insights were only available in the analysis output and a static report after you ran an application analysis. With this enhancement, you can access analysis insights also from the Migration Toolkit for Applications (MTA) user interface (UI).

				(<a class="link" href="https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTA-5420">MTA-5420</a>)
			</p><div class="formalpara"><p class="title"><strong>A new VS Code IDE plug-in for application analysis</strong></p><p>
					With this enhancement, you can use a new Visual Studio Code (VS Code) IDE plug-in that has the following features:
				</p></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem">
						Standard application analysis and issue detection

			</p><div class="formalpara"><p class="title"><strong>Setting default credentials is supported in the MTA UI</strong></p><p>
					Before this update, you could only assign credentials to an application manually once you added or imported this application to the Migration Toolkit for Applications (MTA) user interface (UI). However, you might need to import a large set of applications, each of these applications requiring credentials for language and technology discovery tasks. With this update, instead of manually defining credentials, you can define credentials that will be used by default for an application that does not have any credentials assigned to it.
				</p></div><div class="admonition important"><div class="admonition_header">Important</div><div><p>
					You can only set Maven or source control credentials as default credentials. You can only define one default set of credentials per credential type.

With this update, <code class="literal">mta-cli discover</code> moves both implicit and explicit application-level process types to the <code class="literal">processes</code> block in the discovery manifest.
